**No, your crypto is completely safe!**

When you first set up your wallet, you are given a unique **Secret Recovery Phrase** (a list of 24 words). Think of this phrase as the master key to your digital vault.

If you ever lose your card, you simply use this "master key" to restore full access to your funds on a new Tejory card or any other compatible wallet. Your crypto is tied to your secret phrase, not the physical card. As long as you keep your recovery phrase safe, you are always in control.
