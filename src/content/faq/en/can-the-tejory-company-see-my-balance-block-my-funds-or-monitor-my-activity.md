**No, absolutely not. Your privacy and control are total.**

Think of your Tejory wallet like a high-quality safe that you buy from a store. We manufacture and sell you the safe, but we have absolutely no knowledge of the combination you set, nor do we have a master key. What you do with it and what you put inside is completely private to you.

- **We cannot see your balance or transactions:** The Tejory app connects directly to the public crypto networks. Because we never know your keys, we have no way of identifying which funds on the blockchain belong to you.
- **We cannot freeze or access your funds:** Since we have no access to your keys, we have absolutely no ability to control, block, or move your crypto. Only the person with the physical card (and PIN) or the Secret Recovery Phrase can do that.

This is the true meaning of self-custody, and our entire system is designed from the ground up to guarantee your independence. We don't want to be your bank; we just want to give you the safest and easiest key to your own vault.
