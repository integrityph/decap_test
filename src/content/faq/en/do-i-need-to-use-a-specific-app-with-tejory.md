**Yes, you'll use the free Tejory app, available on the Apple App Store and Google Play.**

The app is your secure dashboard to see your balance and manage your assets. However, all important actions, like approving a payment, require a physical tap of your Tejory card.

For your peace of mind, our app is completely open-source, meaning its code is public for anyone in the world to inspect, ensuring the highest level of transparency and trust.
