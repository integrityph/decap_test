Self-custody simply means **you are your own bank.**

Instead of a company holding your crypto for you, you are in complete control of it yourself. You hold the unique "master key" (your Secret Recovery Phrase) that gives you access to your funds. Itâ€™s the most powerful and secure way to own crypto, and Tejory was created to make this concept safe and incredibly easy for everyone.
