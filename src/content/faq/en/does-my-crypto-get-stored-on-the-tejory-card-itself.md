**No, and this is what makes the system so secure!**

Your crypto always exists on its public network, called the blockchain. Your Tejory card only holds the **private keys**â€”the secret password that proves you are the owner and gives you the power to move your funds.

Think of your card as the highly secure key to your digital vault, not the vault itself. This is why if you lose the key (the card), you can use your backup key (your Secret Recovery Phrase) to regain access to your vault.
