**Not at all! We designed it to be the world's easiest wallet, and setup takes less than 2 minutes.**

Simply open the Tejory app and follow the simple on-screen steps. Youâ€™ll tap your card to your phone and even give your phone a little shake to help create a truly random and secure wallet.

If you have an existing wallet you want to move to Tejory, the process is just as easy and typically takes about 5 minutes.
