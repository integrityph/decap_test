Think of it like the difference between keeping your money in a bank versus holding cash in your own secure safe at home.

When you leave your crypto on an exchange, you are trusting them to hold it for you. With a hardware wallet like Tejory, **you** hold it yourself. This means you are in complete control. No one can freeze your account, block your withdrawals, or lose your funds in a large-scale hack. It's the only way to truly own and control your digital assets.
