**Not a problem! Your crypto is still 100% safe.**

Our cards are built using durable, bank-grade hardware to handle everyday life. However, if your card is ever damaged, your funds are not on the card itself.

Just like if you lost it, you can simply use your **Secret Recovery Phrase** to restore your wallet on a new Tejory card and regain access to all your assets.
