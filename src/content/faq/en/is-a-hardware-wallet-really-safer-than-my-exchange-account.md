**Yes, for one simple reason: it keeps your keys offline.**

Exchanges are giant online targets for hackers, holding billions of dollars in assets. Your Tejory card, however, keeps your private keys completely disconnected from the internet. A hacker can't steal what they can't reach. Itâ€™s the digital equivalent of moving your valuables from a well-known bank vault to your own private, invisible, offline safe.
