**No. Your crypto remains completely safe.**

Your Tejory card is protected by a **PIN code** that only you know. Even if someone steals your card, they cannot approve any transactions without your PIN.

For extra security, if someone enters the wrong PIN three times, the card's secure chip automatically locks itself to prevent any further attempts. A thief would only be left with a useless piece of plastic.
