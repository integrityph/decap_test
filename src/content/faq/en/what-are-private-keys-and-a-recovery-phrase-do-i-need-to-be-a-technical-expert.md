**Absolutely not! Tejory is designed to handle all the technical parts for you.** Here’s a simple breakdown:

- **Private Key:** Think of this as a very long, complex password that your wallet uses to authorize payments. You never have to see or manage this yourself; your Tejory card protects it inside its secure chip.
- **Secret Recovery Phrase:** This is the one thing you need to know. It’s a simple list of 12 or 24 words that acts as the single **master key** for your entire wallet. It’s what you write down and keep safe to recover your funds if you ever lose your card.

In short: Tejory manages the complex "passwords" for you. You just need to keep your simple "master key" safe.
