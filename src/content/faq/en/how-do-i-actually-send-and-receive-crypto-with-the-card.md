**It's as easy as using a contactless wallet (like a credit card)**

- **To Receive Crypto:** Simply copy your public address from the app and share it. You don't need your card for this.
- **To Send Crypto:** Set up the transaction in the app. For final approval, you just **tap your Tejory card** to your phone. The tap physically proves it's really you authorizing the payment.
