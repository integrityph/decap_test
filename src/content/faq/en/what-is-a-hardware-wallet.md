Think of a hardware wallet, like your **Tejory card**, as a highly secure digital vault for your cryptocurrency. ðŸª™

Its main job is to store your **private keys**â€”the secret passwords that prove ownership and give you access to your coinsâ€”on a physical device that is completely **offline**.

Because your keys are kept offline, they are safe from online threats like viruses and hackers that could infect your computer or phone. When you want to send crypto, you use the Tejory card to securely approve the transaction without your private keys ever leaving the device.

This makes it the safest way to manage your own crypto and truly be in control of your assets.
