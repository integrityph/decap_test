# Merchant Services

Break free from the traditional payment ecosystem. With Tejory, there are no gatekeepers, no lengthy approval processes, and no one who can reject your business. Our philosophy is simple: **if you own a Tejory wallet, you are your own payment processor**. This permissionless system puts you in complete control, allowing you to instantly begin accepting cryptocurrency payments from any customer, anywhere in the world. Your business is your own, and your ability to transact should be too.

Our suite of tools is designed for seamless, professional operation. The **Tejory PWA Terminal** instantly transforms any internet-connected device—be it a phone, tablet, or laptop—into a secure point-of-sale terminal. Complementing this is the **Tejory Business** mobile app, your command center for commerce. From the dashboard, you can effortlessly manage and link multiple terminals in different locations, monitor sales in real-time with a comprehensive dashboard, and generate detailed financial reports for your accounting, all tied directly to the security of your hardware wallet.
