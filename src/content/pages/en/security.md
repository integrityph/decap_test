# Our Uncompromising Approach to Security

At Tejory, security isn't a feature; it's the bedrock of our foundation. The heart of every Tejory Core wallet is a state-of-the-art EAL6+ certified Secure Element. This is not merely bank-grade security; it's the same class of tamper-resistant hardware trusted to protect critical data in national security and intelligence applications. This chip acts as an impenetrable vault for your private keys, providing physical and cryptographic protection against a sophisticated range of threats, from side-channel attacks to direct physical manipulation. Your digital assets are isolated within this fortified environment, ensuring they remain under your exclusive control, no matter the external risks.

## 3rd Party Audited

Our commitment to security extends beyond robust hardware to radical transparency. We believe that true trust is earned through independent verification. To that end, the firmware for our JavaCard-based operating system is currently undergoing an exhaustive audit by a leading third-party cybersecurity firm. This meticulous, line-by-line review is designed to rigorously test our code and cryptographic implementations for any potential vulnerabilities. In the spirit of full transparency and our confidence in our architecture, we are committed to publishing the complete audit results for the public to review as soon as they are finalized.

## Post Quantum Protection

Looking to the future, we are actively preparing for the next generation of cryptographic challenges. Tejory Core is built with support for Post-Quantum TLS (PQTLS), ensuring that the communication channels you use to manage your assets are fortified against the looming threat of quantum computing. By implementing algorithms resistant to quantum attacks, we are future-proofing the security of your portfolio. This forward-thinking approach ensures that your assets are protected not just against the threats of today, but for decades to come, providing enduring peace of mind in an evolving digital world.

## Your Assets, Your Control, Always

True ownership means you are always in control, with or without us. That's why every Tejory wallet is built on the universal BIP-39 standard, the industry's most trusted protocol for generating your secret recovery phrase. This phrase is the ultimate master key to your funds, giving you a tangible, offline backup of your entire wallet. Our strict adherence to this open standard guarantees you are never locked into our ecosystem; you are free to take your recovery phrase and restore full access to your assets on any other BIP-39 compatible wallet at any time. This provides a critical layer of security against platform riskâ€”whether you lose your card or our services cease to exist, your funds are always recoverable and remain yours, forever. This is our commitment to true, uncompromising self-sovereignty.
